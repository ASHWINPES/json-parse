# Json Parse

A tool to quickly parse JSON into Java maps and lists. Goes in a pass, so should be `O(n)`.
However, FasterXML's `jackson` still kicks it around. If a heavyweight library needs to be avoided, then this
is a good solution

## Comparison to Jackson (on my machine)

Testing with Jackson's `ObjectMapper` showed a solid 200ms startup time, after which thousands of lines of json could be
read in under a dozen milliseconds.

Json Parse starts up in less that 5ms, but really stumbles on anything other than quick sprints. For example, a
nicely-formatted 2000 line file takes over 4000ms, as opposed to Jackson's 8ms.
