* Lookahead for maps and lists, determining initial size in advance
* Keep the current object in the stack, just in case, rather than thrashing it back and forth (when lots of nested objs)
* Don't strip and reassign string, just pass full object to parse()
* Smarter read-ahead. Say, if we're dealing with a string, jump `i` forward until we hit the other '"'
