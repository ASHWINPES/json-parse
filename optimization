* Lookahead for maps and lists, determining initial size in advance
* Keep the current object in the stack, just in case, rather than thrashing it back and forth (when lots of nested objs)
* Don't strip and reassign string, just pass full object to parse()
* When reading boolean/null, determine what it is at property-completion-time, rather than sorting out the Type in advance
